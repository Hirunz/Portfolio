I'm a final year software engineering undergraduate. I study the software engineering degreee provided by university of westminster in an affiliated university called Informatics institute of technology aka IIT which is located in Sri Lanka. I studied from grade 1-13 in Richmond college galle and passed GCE O/L with 9As and GCE A/L with ABB (combined maths stream whre A is achieved for Combined maths.). I was also selected to the University of COlombo School of Computing Computer Science program but I didn't register since I already completed 2 years at IIT. During my year at IIT , I attended many hackathons and competitions and also achived best 2nd year software engineering project 2021 at cutting edge. I then joined 99x for my internship where I learned a very diverse tech stack and completely serverless architecture using AWS services. Now, I'm in my final year. generate some contents out of this and any other info you might have and provide me very good content for home, about, skills and experiences stuff for my portfolio.

in the skills section I plan on showing my skills and in awards section i plan on discussing my hackathons and awards. also i use experience to include my study details and work details. no need to duplicate stuff. so give kind of a greeting in home page and describe me in brief in about.
